Handcrafted using 100% Nanko ume grown in Japanâ€™s Wakayama prefecture, a region famous for its ume (Japanese plums).  

A balance of initial sweetness and refreshing tartness. Enjoy as an aperitif served straight, on the rocks, or with a splash of soda.  

Nakano umeshu has Geographic Indication (GI) status as Wakayama Umeshu in Japan (the first liqueur, and thirteenth alcoholic beverage overall with GI status in Japan).

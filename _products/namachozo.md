This junmai-shu is brewed using the same dewasanzan and yamada-nishiki rice grains as Nakano’s signature junmai-shu, which gives the sake the same delicate balance of umami, tartness and fruity notes.  

The sake is then raw-stored (this is the namachozō style, as sake is usually pasteurised first), for an extra crisp and refreshing finish.  

From Nakano’s multi-award-winning Kinokuniya Bunzaemon series.

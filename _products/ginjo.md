A multi-award-winning extra smooth and aromatic junmai-ginjō (extra premium) edition from Nakano’s Kinokuniya Bunzaemon (KB) series.  

This ginjō retains Nakano’s signature craftsmanship, with umami and slightly tart and fruity notes carefully balanced. The enhanced polish ratio and careful blending of <i>yamada-nishiki</i> (the ‘King’ of sake rice) and <i>omachi</i> rice (famous for its complexity) amplify the sake’s smoothness and aroma.

720ml, 16% alc/vol

Originally commissioned for the exclusive Kitcho (吉兆) restaurant, which many critics consider as the icon of Japanese haute cuisine.  

Brewed with yamada-nishiki and omachi rice. Strong-bodied, full of umami, with a slight firmness.  

The sake is raw-stored at -5°C for at least 3 years to embed its ripeness, giving a long and crisp finish.  

Serve chilled.

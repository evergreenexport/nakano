Full-bodied with a gentle umami, which spreads through the mouth.

Designed to be the ultimate meal-time sake.

Pair with lighter flavours like sushi, tempura, or grilled fish or chicken.

This sake has been raw-stored at -5Â°C for at least 3 years to embed its ripeness, giving the sake a slight firmness and a crisp finish.

Serve chilled.

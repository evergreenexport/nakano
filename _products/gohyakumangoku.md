A multi-award-winning dry and lighter junmai-shu.  

The brewer's careful use of the distinctive gohyakumangoku rice variety (translates to “5 million stones”, common in Japan’s northwest) makes for a superbly refreshing sake, rich in aroma, and with a clean finish.  

Serve chilled or warm. Recommended for lovers of warm sake.

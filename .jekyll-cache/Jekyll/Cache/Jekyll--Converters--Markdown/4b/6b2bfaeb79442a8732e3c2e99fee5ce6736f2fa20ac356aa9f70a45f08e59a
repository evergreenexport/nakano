I"Ò<p>Nakanoâ€™s multi-award winning signature junmai-shu sake.</p>

<p>Smooth, full-bodied and carefully crafted using yamada-nishiki (the King of sake
rice - sometimes also called the cabernet sauvignon of sake rice) and dewasanzan
(rice famous for its rich aroma). The balance of umami, a slight tartness and fruity
notes makes for a superbly drinkable junmai-shu.</p>

<p>Pairs well with robust flavours, e.g. soy sauce based dishes, rock oysters, or a paella.</p>

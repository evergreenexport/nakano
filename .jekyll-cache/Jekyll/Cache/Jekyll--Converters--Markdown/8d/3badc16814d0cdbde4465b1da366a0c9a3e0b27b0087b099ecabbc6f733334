I"«<p>Brewed to extract the very maximum umami from rice, this junmai-shu from
Nakanoâ€™s ultra series measures +17.8 on the sake scale. While this places it
at the super-dry end of the sake spectrum at face value, it carries an umami
that blooms in the mouth, giving the sake a gentler flavour profile.</p>

<p>This is a junmai-shu that allows the drinker to enjoy both the true umami of
rice, alongside a very clean finish.</p>

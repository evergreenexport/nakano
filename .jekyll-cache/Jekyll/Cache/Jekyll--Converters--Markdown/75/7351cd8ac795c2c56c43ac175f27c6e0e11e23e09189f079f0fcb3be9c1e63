I"J<p>Nakano’s multi-award winning signature junmai-shu sake.<br /><br />
Smooth, full-bodied and carefully crafted using yamada-nishiki (the ‘King’ of sake rice) and dewasanzan (rice famous for its rich aroma).<br /><br />
The balance of umami and slightly tart and fruity notes makes for a superbly drinkable junmai-shu.</p>

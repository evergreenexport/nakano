I"Æ<p>This junmai-shu is brewed using the same dewasanzan and yamada-nishiki rice grains as Nakano‚Äôs signature junmai-shu, which gives the sake the same delicate balance of umami, tartness and fruity notes.</p>

<p>The sake is then raw-stored (this is the namachoz≈çstyle, as sake is usually pasteurised first), for an extra crisp and refreshing finish.</p>

<p>From Nakano‚Äôs multi-award-winning Kinokuniya Bunzaemon series.</p>

I"û<p>Brewed 100% with the rich yet complex bizen-omachi rice, also known as ‚Äúthe
phantom sake rice‚Äù for its scarceness and difficulty to grow.</p>

<p>It has a smoother, juicy flavour profile (the Bordeaux red of the sake world),
full of umami, and balanced with a tartness and crisp finish that still makes it moreish.</p>

<p>This sake is best enjoyed from a wine glass where you can enjoy its full aroma.</p>

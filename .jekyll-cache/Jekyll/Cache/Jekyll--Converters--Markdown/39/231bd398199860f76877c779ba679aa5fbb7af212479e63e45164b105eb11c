I"[<p>Crafted using 100% Nanko ume grown in Japan’s Wakayama prefecture, which
have been hand-sorted and soaked in alcohol on the same day they’ve been
harvested.</p>

<p>A balance of initial sweetness and refreshing tartness. Enjoy as an aperitif
served straight, on the rocks, or with a splash of soda.</p>

<p>Nanko ume are widely regarded as the premier ume for making umeshu, due to
their abundant flesh, soft peach-like aroma and high organic acid content.
Wakayama Prefecture is the most famous region in Japan for ume production (in
particular for nanko ume) due to its favourable climate.</p>

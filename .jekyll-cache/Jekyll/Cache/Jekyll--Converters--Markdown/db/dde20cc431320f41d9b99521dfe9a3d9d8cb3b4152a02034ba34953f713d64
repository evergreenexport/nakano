I"ù<p>This junmai-shu is brewed using the same yamada-nishiki and dewasanzan rice
grains as Nakano‚Äôs signature junmai-shu, which gives the sake the same delicate
balance of umami, tartness and fruity notes.</p>

<p>The sake is then raw-stored (this is the namachoz≈ç style, as sake is usually
pasteurised first). This gives the sake a longer finish and a more distinctive
aroma.</p>

<p>Serve chilled or warm.</p>

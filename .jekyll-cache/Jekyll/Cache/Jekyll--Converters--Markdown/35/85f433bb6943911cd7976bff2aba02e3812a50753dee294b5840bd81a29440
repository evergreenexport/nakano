I"m<p>Brewed 100% with the rich yet complex bizen-omachi rice, also known as “the phantom sake rice” for its scarceness and difficulty to grow.</p>

<p>The result is an elegant ginjō, juicy and full of umami, balanced with moderate tartness and an extra long and crisp finish. Enjoy with bold flavours like blue cheese or smoked meats.</p>

<p>Serve chilled.</p>

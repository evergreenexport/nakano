I"w<p>Brewed to extract the very maximum umami from rice, this junmai-shu from
Nakanoâ€™s ultra series measures +17.8 on the sake scale. While this places it
at the super-dry end of the sake spectrum at face value, it carries an umami
that blooms in the mouth, giving the sake a gentler flavour profile.</p>

<p>This is a junmai-shu that allows the drinker to enjoy both the true umami of
rice, alongside a very clean finish.</p>

<p>Pairs well with lighter, more delicate flavours, e.g. sashimi, sushi, Bluff
oysters, tempura, or panko crumbed fish or chicken. Or enjoy as a palate
cleanser with fried foods like fish and chips.</p>

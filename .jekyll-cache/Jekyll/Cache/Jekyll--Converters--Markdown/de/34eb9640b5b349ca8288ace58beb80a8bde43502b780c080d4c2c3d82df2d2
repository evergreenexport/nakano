I"±<p>A smooth, aromatic and fruity sake. Brewed using yamada-nishiki (the King of
sake rice) and omachi rice (famous for its complexity). The word ‚Äúginj≈ç‚Äù means
that at least 40% of the rice has been polished off - sake in this category
tends to be sweeter, with a fruitier aroma.</p>

<p>Enjoy this sake as the main event, or paired with a soft cheese. Try using a wider
glass where you can experience the full fruity aroma.</p>

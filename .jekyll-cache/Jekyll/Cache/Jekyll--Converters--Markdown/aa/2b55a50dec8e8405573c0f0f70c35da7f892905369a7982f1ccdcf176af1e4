I"¿<p>A multi-award-winning extra smooth and aromatic junmai-ginjÅ (extra premium) edition from Nakanoâ€™s Kinokuniya Bunzaemon (KB) series.
This ginjÅ retains Nakanoâ€™s signature craftsmanship, with umami and slightly tart and fruity notes carefully balanced. The enhanced polish ratio and careful blending of yamada-nishiki (the â€˜Kingâ€™ of sake rice) and omachi rice (famous for its complexity) amplify the sakeâ€™s smoothness and aroma.</p>

I"Z<p>A multi-award-winning dry and lighter junmai-shu sake. <br /><br />
The brewer’s careful use of the distinctive gohyakumangoku rice variety (translates to “5 million stones”, common in Japan’s northwest) makes for a superbly refreshing sake, rich in aroma, and with a clean finish.<br /><br />
Recommended for lovers of warm sake.</p>

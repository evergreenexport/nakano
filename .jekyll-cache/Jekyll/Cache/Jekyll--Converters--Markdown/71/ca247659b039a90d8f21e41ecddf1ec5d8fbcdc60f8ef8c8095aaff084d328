I"a<p>An extra premium ume (plum) liqueur, handcrafted using only crimson ripened nanko ume from Wakayama (called “beninanko”), which have been hand-selected one-by-one and soaked in spirits on the same day.
The producer uses one-and-a-half times the plums of Nakano’s signature umeshu, producing a liqueur with accentuated richness and flavour.</p>

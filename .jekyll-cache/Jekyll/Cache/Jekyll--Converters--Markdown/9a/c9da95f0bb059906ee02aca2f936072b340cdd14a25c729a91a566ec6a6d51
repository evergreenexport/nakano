I"Ã<p>A multi-award-winning dry and lighter junmai-shu sake.</p>

<p>The brewerâ€™s careful use of the distinctive <em>gohyakumangoku</em> rice variety
(translates to â€œ5 million stonesâ€, common in Japanâ€™s northwest) makes for a
superbly refreshing sake, rich in aroma, and with a clean finish.</p>

<p>Pairs well with lighter, more delicate flavours, e.g. sashimi, sushi, Bluff
oysters, or tempura.</p>

<p>Recommended for lovers of warm sake.</p>

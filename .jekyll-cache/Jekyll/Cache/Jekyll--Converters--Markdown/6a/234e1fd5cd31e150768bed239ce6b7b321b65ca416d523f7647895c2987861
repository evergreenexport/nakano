I"ü<p>This junmai-shu is brewed using the same dewasanzan and yamada-nishiki rice grains as Nakano‚Äôs signature junmai-shu, which gives the sake the same delicate balance of umami, tartness and fruity notes.
The sake is then raw-stored (this is the namachoz≈ç style, as sake is usually pasteurised first), for an extra crisp and refreshing finish.
From Nakano‚Äôs multi-award-winning Kinokuniya Bunzaemon series.</p>

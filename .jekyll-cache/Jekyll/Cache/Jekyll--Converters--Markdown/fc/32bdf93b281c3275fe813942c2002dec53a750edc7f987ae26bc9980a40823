I"<p>This junmai-shu is brewed using the same yamada-nishiki and dewasanzan rice
grains as Nakano’s signature junmai-shu, which gives the sake the same delicate
balance of umami, tartness and fruity notes.</p>

<p>The sake is then raw-stored (this is the namachozō style, as sake is usually
pasteurised first). This gives the sake a longer finish and a more distinctive
aroma.</p>

<p>Just like Nakano’s signature junmai-shu, this sake pairs well with robust
flavours, e.g. soy sauce based dishes, rock oysters, or a paella.</p>

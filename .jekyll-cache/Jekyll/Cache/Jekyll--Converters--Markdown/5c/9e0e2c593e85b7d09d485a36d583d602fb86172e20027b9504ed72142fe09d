I"˘<p>Brewed using 100% yamada-nishiki rice (aka the King of sake rice - sometimes
also called the cabernet sauvignon of sake rice) from the Kita-iki-iki Collective
in Minami-aso village in the Kyushu highlands, who are famous for their pure waters
and sustainable farming methods.</p>

<p>The rice is polished down to 55% to produce a very clear sake, with elegant
aroma and subtle umami.</p>

<p>The sake rice has been grown using ‚Äúnatural cultivation‚Äù. This is a farming
method that does not use any pesticides, herbicides or fertilisers (including
organic fertilisers). It relies solely on the power of nature to grow crops.
The yield is lower than more traditional rice farming and weeding is more
difficult. There is no compromise on the quality of the sake rice, while the
beautiful Minami-aso environment is safeguarded for future generations.</p>

<p>Pair this sake with snacks or dishes with a good umami profile, e.g. mushroom
risotto, avocado, parmesan or gouda cheese, or tomato based pasta dishes.</p>
